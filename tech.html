		<p>For fun, I like to tinker with arduinos, raspberry pis, web applications, and industrial sewing machines. Maybe one of these days I'll combine them all into one big project. A few years ago I made a light up programmable LED dress, which taught me a lot about programming and electronics. I did a lightning talk about it at a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-SF/">Women Who Code</a> meetup, and you can checkout the video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80j9Igt_H7Y&feature=share&list=PLC838FC9830E66AF7">here</a>. I have grand plans to make more interactive clothing using Lilypad and arduino sensors. Also on the list is to hack my slow cooker to provide me with temperature control and recipe sourcing, all accessible from the web.</p>
