There was also a bit of discussion today about certain blacklisted companies, or those that Hackbright will not refer students to for work after the program due to the fact that the working environment is not very welcoming towards women/minorities/etc. I'm finding it frustrating that in this day and age, in San Francisco of all places, we still have companies that are not welcoming to all people, companies that cater to a certain type of person and foster that environment that is not welcoming to all. Of course, companies cannot legally exclude people, but they basically do when they perpetuate a company culture that isn't welcoming.

Last night, we went to the PyLadies Mini PyCon, which was pretty interesting. The talks were not as technical as they could have been, but were still pretty interesting. I was a little dismayed at the "lack" of attendence - not that there wasn't a good turnout, but that there are not enough women in tech to fill out the room. It's hard to get motivated starting something out when there is less support than you would like to see.
