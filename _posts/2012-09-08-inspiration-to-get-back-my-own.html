I feel as though recently I've spent a lot of time supporting others in their efforts to be creative, and have in turn suppressed my own creativity, since I cannot do both at the same time. I'm hoping that taking some time off, and then starting to really learn a new skill (I'm enrolled for <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com/">Hackbright's</a> 2012 session) will help me get it back. Lifehacker has had some really great articles recently, and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5940145/why-creativity-blocks-happen-and-how-to-overcome-them">this one</a> on overcoming creative blocks is super helpful. I hope to be back to my wacky think outside the box brain in no time!
