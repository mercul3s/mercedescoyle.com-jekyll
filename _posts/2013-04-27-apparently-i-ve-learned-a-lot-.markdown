I've never been a good journal-keeper; I do enjoy writing but not necessarily cataloguing. I am, however, getting much better at taking notes. As I go through learning adventures, it's been revealing and humoring to look back at my notes and realize how much I've learned, and how much worse my handwriting has become as my typing has gotten better. Evernote has replaced google docs as my digital notebook of sorts, and I tend to have a moleskin on my person at all times. At work, I've made it a point to take copious notes, dated so I can easily refer back to them, on every new thing or meeting about something that comes my way.
