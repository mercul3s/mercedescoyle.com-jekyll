Glad that I'm no longer going to be doing desktop support:

- when I see people take their laptops with them to the bathroom (this was at work!)
- users trying to run netinstall for OS upgrade over wifi
- users who have 3-5 character passwords, or ones that contain their username or the site they're logging into
