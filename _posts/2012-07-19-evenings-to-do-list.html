I've had a netbook for a couple years now, gathering dust on my desk. It was an impulse purchase from <a href="http://indamixx.com/" title="indamixx">these guys</a>, and sounded really neat. A linux based netbook engineered for making music! In reality, the one window at-a-time and the difficulty getting all the applications to play nicely with one another rendered it unusable. So, hence the desk and dust. I still feel guilty about it. I think tonight it's time to install a new flavor of linux. I'll probably end up just installing Ubuntu as it's what I'm familiar with, but I may give Mint Linux a try on the recommendation of a coworker. Both seem to have full support (or so it seems) for this particular netbook's hardware. I'm hoping a different windowing system will help me get more out of it.
