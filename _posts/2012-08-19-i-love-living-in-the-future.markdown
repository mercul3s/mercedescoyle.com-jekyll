Especially when I read about stuff like <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/134672-harvard-cracks-dna-storage-crams-700-terabytes-of-data-into-a-single-gram" title="dna storage" target="_blank">this</a>, in which geneticists sequence a very large amount of data to a very small volume of DNA. It kind of blows my mind - it's definitely not for quick data retrieval, but can be very accurate and is apparently stable for thousands of years. So, much more archival than anything we've got now, especially compared to magnetic media which has gone through several rounds of obsolescence in the past 50 years or so. Makes me wonder: is there a need for private key encryption in DNA data sequencing?
