About 4 years ago I became smitten with the idea of becoming an aquarist. My boyfriend had a gigantic turtle tank, with one wild-born red eared slider he picked up in Florida. I had just moved into my very own studio apartment, and thought it might be cool to get a fish tank, since I was allergic to cats and the boyfriend allergic to anything furry. My previous experience with fish, besides the eating kind, was a 10-gallon tank filled with too many fancy goldfish that our cats became more fascinated with than us kids. Needless to say, those fish did not fare well. My adult self wanted to make up for it.

I hemmed and hawed over what to get, and eventually forgot about the fish tank since I couldn't make up my mind. I ended up moving out of my studio and into the boyfriend's apartment, and then we both moved to a new place with a bit more room. We broke the turtle tank in the process. Instead of buying the same tank, which was serviceable but not fancy, he opted to purchase a beautiful new rimless tank with natural wood platforms and a sump filter. The filter had to be special ordered, so we took just the tank home and set it up with enough for the turtle to get by for a few days.

When the boyfriend picked up the sump, he returned with a surprise - a red Betta fish all for me! My initial reaction was along the lines of "oh shit, now I have something that relies on me - I hope I don't kill it." As it turns out, I didn't kill it. Dante the Betta lived in a tiny 1/2 gallon tank for a few months, and after doing some research, I moved him into a 5 gallon fluval chi, which was a perfect Betta tank. Plenty of room, very pretty, and a low powered filter so he could easily get around.
