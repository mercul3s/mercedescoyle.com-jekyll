As of 9/4:

<ul>
	<li>Netbook is now starting to be functional! Installed 3 browsers: Midori, Dillo (compiled from source), and Lynx (oh yeah old skool), enabled ssh and disabled port 22 access, and enabled remote desktop.</li>
	<li>Secured my facebook &amp; twitter logins via 2-factor auth.</li>
<li>Started a password database and changed a bunch of passwords to be more secure.</li>
<li>Tried to restore my old phone pics from a backup, and realized that the phone backup doesn't exist (oh well)</li>
<li>Bike ride - ~12 miles, around Lake Merced, for some much needed exercise. Going to try to do a ride every day!</li>
</ul>

Still to do:
<ul>
	<li>Lock down ssh even more (via key / user) on the netbook</li>
<li>Setup DNS service on the netbook or VM on the big mac</li>
<li>Setup Nagios to ping my server and let me know if it's down</li>
<li>Learn about Version Control in Wordpress so I can get started customizing</li>
<li>Setup a VPN</li>
<li>Get Wifi working on the netbook</li>
<li>Design some Name Cards</li>
<li>Play around in Illustrator to work out some laser cutter ideas I have</li>
<li>Make some Pudding because it's awesome</li>
</ul>
