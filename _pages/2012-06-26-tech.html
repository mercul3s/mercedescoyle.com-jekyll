By day, I do stuff with systems such as OS X Server, Open Directory, JAMF Casper Suite, CrashPlan, and Ubuntu server. Recent projects include: Open Directory management such as replication, automating OD backups, command line level troubleshooting of mac server systems, automating nrpe to start at boot on mac, migrating CrashPlan server. 

For fun, I like to play around with html, css, javascript, and arduinos. A few years ago I made a light up programmable LED dress. I have grand plans to make more interactive clothing using Lilypad and arduino sensors. Also on the list is to hack my slow cooker to provide me with temperature and on/off control, accessible from the web. I've also been intrigued by the <a href="http://www.twilio.com/" title="twilio" target="_blank">Twilio</a> API. I'd also like to create a choose your own adventure game/story based off sms or voip using the Twilio API, loosely based off the Choose Your Own Adventure books of the 80's that I grew up with.
