A few weeks ago, I found myself hacking away with a team on an arduino morse code to twitter project with an awesome team of women at Silicon Chef, a hardware hacakthon run by [Hackbright Academy](http://hackbrightacademy.com). At the start, I thought our idea was going to be a fairly simple project - use a pushbutton to tap morse code into an Arduino, convert it to text (or leave it as morse code), and publish it to Twitter using the API. Well, that simple little idea turned out to be non-trivial to implement, but I learned a ton from trying it out.
