I'm trying to teach myself how to program an SMS application using <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio's</a> API. Since I'm not familiar with it, I'm using PHP in order to teach myself a new language (and also since it's simple and there are a ton of resources). Backup for a second - when I was learning Perl, I had a lot of trouble interpreting and using hashes (also known as <strong>associative arrays</strong>). Present time again - I'm looking up how to define arrays, and I take a look at some documentation and this <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596157142.do">book</a>, and what do I see? associative arrays, staring me in the face. And then I realize that associative arrays are similar to our traditional arrays, but the indexes (keys) are whatever you want them to be instead of integers. I think I've had that aha! moment. Coding rocks!
