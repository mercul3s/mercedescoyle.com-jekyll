I'm en route back from [RESTfest](#) and since I'm on a plane, I thought I'd take a moment to reflect on some awesome things about it and the other two conferences I've attended and spoken at this year. Out of the three, my employer was only invovled with getting me to [DevOps Days](#), where my work mentor and I gave a well-received talk on bringing on new engineers. Pycon and RESTfest I attended on my own, but with the blessing of my employer. Overall, I've been encouraged and welcomed into these new communities, and I have learned so much. 2-3 days of conference and interaction leaves me exhausted and talked out, but completely excited, inspired, and full of new ideas.

**Pycon**

I attended Pycon in March, just after starting my new job. Due to their fantastic outreach program, I and a number of [Hackbright](#) alumnas were able to go on a grant which covered the cost of the conference pass. Initially, my approach here was to try to attend as many talks as I could and take copious amounts of notes; Pycon is pretty large, and usually has 3-4 talks going on simultaneously. Day 3 had me pretty tired and talked out. They did a number of things to increase speaker and attendee diversity:

Key Takeaways:

concept of workflow/queue/worker/decider - Hypermedia
no longer afraid of xml and the semantic web
standards are awesome! Let's all use them and improve existing ones instead of reinventing our own.
notion of content driven browsing instead of url/web based browsing
urls should be unimportant - your API should inform where your client goes to get information
thinking of APIs and data as link relationships
the web is a distributed system  
Everyone talks, Open Space/Unconference: this model is great for unpretentious talks and questions  
technical conferences have a lot to do with the thought process and not only the implementation
