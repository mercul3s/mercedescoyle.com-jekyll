		My main squeeze: <a href="http://dotpuntomusic.com/" title="Dot Punto." target="_blank">Dot Punto.</a> An indie latin rock band from San Francisco, in which I play drums, a small amount of backing vocals, and a smattering of odd musical instruments such as thumb piano and melodica. We play shows around the San Francisco Bay Area - check our <a href="http://dotpuntomusic.com/#" title="Dot Punto." target="_blank">website</a> for upcoming events.

    Musical projects: I'm currently working on Druss, a.k.a the Drum Dress. Druss is a wearable midi percussion interface based off a Spikenzie labs Drumkit Kit AI and (hopefully) a Raspberry Pi acting as a brain and audio output interface. The inspiration for Druss is that I've always wanted to have a more tactile, movement enabling percussion interface, so I can escape from behind my wall of drums and be closer to the audience. Doing so will be an exercise in expanding my comfort zone as a performer, since I tend to do so reluctantly.
